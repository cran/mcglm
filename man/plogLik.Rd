\title{Gaussian Pseudo-Loglikelihood}
\usage{
plogLik(object, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{mcglm} or a list of such objects.
When a list is supplied, the pseudo-loglikelihood is computed for the
joint model obtained by stacking the responses, fitted values and
covariance matrices of all elements in the list.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether the pseudo-loglikelihood value
should be printed to the console. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An invisible list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{plogLik}{A numeric value giving the Gaussian pseudo-loglikelihood.}
  \item{df}{An integer giving the total number of estimated parameters
  (degrees of freedom) used in the model.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the Gaussian pseudo-loglikelihood for fitted multivariate
covariance generalized linear models. The pseudo-loglikelihood is
obtained by assuming a multivariate normal distribution for the
stacked response vector, using the estimated mean vector and
covariance matrix from the fitted \code{mcglm} object.
}
\details{
The Gaussian pseudo-loglikelihood is computed as
\deqn{
  \ell_p = -\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi)
           - \frac{1}{2}\log|\Sigma|
           - \frac{1}{2}(y - \mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (y - \mu),
}
where \eqn{y} is the stacked vector of observed responses, \eqn{\mu} is
the stacked vector of fitted means, and \eqn{\Sigma} is the estimated
covariance matrix. For a list of \code{mcglm} objects, block-diagonal
covariance matrices are constructed internally.

This quantity is used mainly for model comparison purposes and as a
building block for pseudo-information criteria such as \code{pAIC}
and \code{pBIC}. It is not a true likelihood unless the Gaussian
assumption holds.

Description: Fitting multivariate covariance generalized linear
     models (McGLMs) to data.  McGLM is a general framework for non-normal
     multivariate data analysis, designed to handle multivariate response
     variables, along with a wide range of temporal and spatial correlation
     structures defined in terms of a covariance link function combined
     with a matrix linear predictor involving known matrices.
     The models take non-normality into account in the conventional way
     by means of a variance function, and the mean structure is modelled
     by means of a link function and a linear predictor.
     The models are fitted using an efficient Newton scoring algorithm
     based on quasi-likelihood and Pearson estimating functions, using
     only second-moment assumptions. This provides a unified approach to
     a wide variety of different types of response variables and covariance
     structures, including multivariate extensions of repeated measures,
     time series, longitudinal, spatial and spatio-temporal structures.
     The package offers a user-friendly interface for fitting McGLMs
     similar to the glm() R function.
